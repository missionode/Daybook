# Daybook
A minimal, responsive day-planner that feels like a diary: drag &amp; resize tasks on a vertical timeline, quick search with “Next” navigation, Sunday/ custom holidays, auto-postpone unfinished tasks, and share-out. Data lives locally (localStorage) with an optional remembered auto-backup to a chosen .json file via the File System Access API.
